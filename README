model

a board with 64 positions

1 white band with 8 peons, 1 king, 1 queen, 2 horses, 2 bishops and 2 towers

1 black band with 8 peons, 1 king, 1 queen, 2 horses, 2 bishops and 2 towers

an initialize method to put the pieces on the initial positions

a move method to move a piece to a desired position: this one can be automatic (the program can choose) or manual passing piece and new position

a validate method passing a piece an old position and a new position, validates if the movement is possible

an isFree method passing a position

a nextTurn method to decide what band should move

an is King on danger method

an is Queen on danger method

a kill method passing a piece and a position, piece is then eliminated from the band or put as not available

an available method for one piece

for one piece and position, all possible movements
    peon in position 5 can move to 5+8 if free or to 5+7 or 5+9 if are not free (within the limits of the board => result < 64)

    torre in position 5 can move to 5+(8*x) siempre que no se salga de los limites y en las positions 5+(8*x) no haya nadie, si hay alguien ese es el limite de x
        tambien puede mover a 5-(8*x)
        tambien a 5+-(1*x) siempre que el resultado sea 0-8 => 8%5 = 3 x puede ser hasta 2 y 5-8=0 asi que el minimo es 0, 20-8=12 8%12=4 ->12+4=16 y 20%8=4-> x maximo es 24-1=23

     el rey es +-1 +-8 +-9 +-7

     el caballo es +15 +17 -15 -17 +10 +6 -10 -6, puede saltar asi que no hay que comprobar nada

view
a canvas with 64 cells black and white like a chess board with numbers and letters in the borders

a draw method that draws the current status of the model

if a cell is not free, this cell can listen for drag events -> take

if a cell is free, this cell can listen for drop events -> move

if a cell is not free, this cell can listen for drop events -> kill



control
when you pick a piece and move it a validation of the movement should be done and an analysis of the dangers for the queen and the king have to be done

once whites listen for drag and drop, afterwards, blacks and so on
